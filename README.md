PythonSamples
=============

Some projects from my Computer Systems class at UChicago.

Projects 6,7 and 8 are code samples from a class I'm taking in Computer systems.  It follows the curriculum of the book "The Elements of Computer Systems", by Nisan and Schoken.

As the material in the book is sometimes used for classes that give grades, please do not copy any of my code for a class project.  Otherwise I am happy to share.

The other project is a webserver that was written in Bottle last year to work with Amazon Web Service.  It is very rudimentary but it was fun to work on, and I'd like to fix it up some more when I have more time.  It was hosted on one of the EC2 servers in Amazon's data centers.
